# StackGAN - Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions

Implementation of "Stage 1 " of StackGAN Stage I of StackGAN 1- takes input as text, 2- convert the text to embedding using our pre-trained character level embedding. 3- Then, we give this embedding to Conditional Augmentation (CA) and 4- then to Stage I Generator which gives us low-resolution 64*64 images.
